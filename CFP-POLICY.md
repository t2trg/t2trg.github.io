We all loathe being spammed with CfP announcements (Calls for Papers).
On the other hand, we like it when members of our community run events
or organize publications that are relevant to our work.  A personal
note with a pointer to such an opportunity, some explanation how our
research group work fits in, and maybe even another message with a
summary of important outcomes after the event is totally in line with
the purpose of this mailing list.

We are working on finding a CfP policy for the T2TRG mailing list
that hits a good balance between making useful information available to
research group members and not spamming the list.

For now, we'll work with the below policy.  If your message falls
squarely into this policy, feel free to post it to the list.  If you
are unsure, please contact <t2trg-chairs@ietf.org>.
Comments/questions welcome, too!

# Policy for CfP announcements and similar solicitations

Call for Papers (CfP) e-mails to the T2TRG mailing list are acceptable
if they are messages from active T2TRG participants, associated with
specific information on how the call is relevant to the T2TRG agenda.
For conferences, the message also should indicate how T2TRG will be
represented at the event.
